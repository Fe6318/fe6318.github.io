          <div id="teamdes">The Freedom Engineers are a FIRST robotics team from Freedom High School, the team began in 2017, through the help of many students and teachers. The team is a non-profit organization working to improve the lives of students, with 501(c)(3) status. Currently, the team consists of students from Freedom High School who are coached and mentored by professionals in STEM fields. Students learn the ins and outs of STEM fields and are able to gain important life skills.
